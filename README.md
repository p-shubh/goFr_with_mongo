![Application Banner](https://github.com/gofr-dev/gofr/assets/44036979/916fe7b1-42fb-4af1-9e0b-4a7a064c243c)

## Overview

This project is a Go-based application utilizing **GORF** as the ORM and **MongoDB** as the database. It is designed for simplicity, scalability, and performance, making it ideal for modern web applications.

## Features

* **GORF Integration:** Simplifies database operations with an intuitive ORM layer.
* **MongoDB:** A robust and scalable NoSQL database for handling structured and unstructured data.
* **RESTful API:** Fully functional endpoints to interact with the application.
* **Containerization:** Docker support for easy deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (optional, for containerization)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Configure the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection details:
   ```dotenv
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
5. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.
